# JTNA Client (React + Vite + Tailwind)

Simple demo React app with a login page and a protected dashboard. Styled with Tailwind CSS.

Default demo credentials:
- username: `admin`
- password: `password`

Quick start:

```bash
# from project root
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and sign in with the demo credentials.

Notes:
- This project uses a fake auth flow: successful login stores a dummy token in localStorage.
- For real projects, replace the auth check with an API call and secure token handling.
